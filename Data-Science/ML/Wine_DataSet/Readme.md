# Data Set Information:

These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.   

In a classification context, this is a well posed problem with "well behaved" class structures. A good data set for first testing of a new classifier, but not very challenging.

We will approach this problem as a regression task and regress the Origin/Class of Wine Using chemical analysis determine the origin of wines
